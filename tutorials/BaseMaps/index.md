The user is going to learn how to change the options of the map object to create new web maps

## The default maps in Earth Engine

  

Inside your sections, you can also:

1. Use numbered lists
1. ..when the order..
1. ..of items is important.

And:

- This is a bulleted list.
- Use bulleted lists when items are not strictly ordered.

..and even:

Use     | tables   | to organize | content
------- | -------- | ----------- | -------
Your    | tables   | can         | also
contain | multiple | rows        | ...

## Section heading 2

Use separate sections for related, but discrete, groups of steps.

Use code blocks to show users how to do something after describing it:

```
// Use comments to describe details that can't be easily expressed in code.
// Always try making code more self descriptive before adding a comment.
// Similarly, avoid repeating verbatim what's already said in code
// (e.g., "assign ImageCollection to variable 'coll'").
var coll = ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_TOA');
```

### Use subsections if appropriate

Consider breaking longer sections that cover multiple topics or span multiple
pages into subsections.
